# Aali's Reader · اردو — AI Study Reader in English and Urdu

An offline first Android reading app for students. It opens PDF, EPUB, TXT, PowerPoint and Word files,
lets you tap any word for an instant dictionary meaning in English **and Urdu**, reads the book aloud
while highlighting the word being spoken, recognises English and **Urdu** text inside scanned pages
without any internet, and can summarise a chapter with AI when you are online.

Built for the **Pak Angels Generative & Agentic AI Hackathon**. This is the Urdu edition: everything
the reader did in English it now also does in Urdu, offline.

## The problem

A science student in Pakistan reads most of their course material on a phone, from PDFs and scanned
notes shared on WhatsApp. Three things get in the way:

1. **Unknown words break reading.** Switching to a browser to look up *anhydrous* or *glomerulus*
   costs attention and mobile data, and often there is no data at all.
2. **Scanned notes are dead images.** A photographed page cannot be searched, selected, copied or
   read aloud, which also shuts out anyone who reads with their ears rather than their eyes.
3. **Study material lives in five formats.** Lecture slides are .pptx, assignments are .docx,
   textbooks are .pdf, novels are .epub. Most readers handle one of them.

## The solution

One reader that stays useful with the aeroplane mode on.

| Capability | How it works | Needs internet |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tap a word for its meaning | 273,221 word dictionary bundled in the APK as SQLite | No |
| Urdu meanings, both ways | 64,378 Urdu words with English meanings, 27,148 English words with Urdu meanings | No |
| Urdu scanned pages become text | Tesseract with the Urdu LSTM model, plus a dictionary based repair pass for Nastaliq | No |
| Deeper or rarer terms | Wiktionary and Wikipedia lookup as a second opinion | Yes |
| Read aloud with word tracking | Android TTS, the spoken word is highlighted and the page follows the voice | No |
| Scanned pages become text | ML Kit text recognition, model bundled in the APK | No |
| Chapter and book summary | Google Gemini, using your own free API key | Yes |
| Slides and documents in their real design | Custom OOXML renderer, not a text dump | No |

## Features

**Reading**

- PDF, EPUB, TXT, PPTX and DOCX in one library
- PowerPoint and Word open in their **original layout** — shape positions, theme colours and fonts,
  pictures and tables — scaled to fit and pinch zoomable exactly like a PDF page
- Continuous vertical PDF scrolling, night mode, go to page, side scroll bar
- Immersive mode: tap the middle of the page to hide the bars
- Auto scroll with real reading speeds (150 to 400 words per minute)

**Understanding**

- Tap any word on any format, including on the PDF page itself, for an instant definition
- Select a phrase for a combined lookup, or drag the handles down to a single letter
- Difficult word lists, one per book plus a master list, saved for revision
- Per book search history
- AI summary of a chapter, a selection or the whole book, with equations converted from LaTeX
  into readable Unicode (V₂O₅, 1.06 F g⁻¹) instead of raw markup

**Urdu · اردو**

- Tap an Urdu word in any book for its English meaning, pronunciation and, where known, its Urdu
  explanation, all offline
- Every English definition also shows the Urdu meaning (اردو معنی), so a student reading an English
  textbook sees both
- Inflected words are traced to their dictionary form: کتابوں → کتاب, لڑکیاں → لڑکی, کرتے → کرنا
- Scanned Urdu pages are recognised on the phone, then made tappable, selectable and speakable
- Urdu text is laid out right to left in the Noto Nastaliq Urdu typeface, in EPUB, TXT and the
  meaning panel; Urdu PDFs are read in the correct right to left order
- Read aloud switches to an Urdu voice for Urdu passages and back to English for English ones
- Old Urdu text files saved in the Windows Arabic code page open correctly

**Listening**

- Read aloud the whole book, a chapter or just the selected passage
- The word being spoken is highlighted and the page scrolls with the voice, in portrait and in
  zoomed landscape
- Speed and voice follow the phone's text to speech settings

**Keeping**

- Highlights and notes saved to the database **and** written as plain .txt files with book name and
  page number into a visible `Aali Reader/Highlights` folder on phone storage
- Export highlights and notes to a formatted PDF
- Bookmarks, comments and notes anywhere in a book
- Reading statistics: minutes per day, a 7 day chart and a daily streak
- Full backup and restore as a single zip, so a new phone keeps everything

## How it was built

This app was specified in plain language and generated, not hand written.

1. **Describe** — the app was written out as a request: a Kindle style reader with a tap dictionary,
   read aloud, highlights, offline text recognition and an AI summary.
2. **Generate** — **Claude Opus 5** turned each request into working Kotlin.
3. **Build** — an agent drove the developer's own laptop through Desktop Commander: writing the
   files, running Gradle, reading the build log and fixing its own compile errors.
4. **Test** — every APK was installed on a real phone, and whatever broke went back as a crash log
   or a screenshot.
5. **Repeat** — ten builds, version 1.0 to 1.9, each feature and each fix going round the same loop.

38 Kotlin files and 9,393 lines, none of them typed by hand. Version 1.9 added Urdu the same way:
one request, and the model built the Urdu dictionary from Wiktionary dumps, tested the Urdu OCR model
against rendered Nastaliq text, and wrote the dictionary repair pass that fixes its common misreadings.

## Install

1. Download **[AaliReader-v1.9-arm64.apk](https://github.com/JH-Aali-7/aalis-reader-urdu/releases/latest/download/AaliReader-arm64.apk)** (68 MB).
2. On the phone, allow installing from unknown sources when asked.
3. Open the app, grant storage access, then copy any book into `Aali Reader/Books` or import from the
   library screen.
4. Optional: Settings → AI key, paste a free Google Gemini key from
   [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) to switch AI summaries on.

If it refuses to install on an older 32 bit phone, use the [armv7 APK](https://github.com/JH-Aali-7/aalis-reader-urdu/releases/latest/download/AaliReader-armv7.apk) instead.
5. For Urdu read aloud: Settings → Urdu → *Get the Urdu voice*, and download the Urdu voice once so it
   works offline.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JH-Aali-7/aalis-reader-urdu.git
cd aalis-reader-urdu
# point local.properties at your Android SDK, for example
#   sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\you\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

APKs land in `app/build/outputs/apk/release/`. Open the folder in Android Studio and press Run for
day to day work.

.github/workflows/build-apk.yml           builds, tests, signs and publishes the APKs on every change
keystore/ci-debug.keystore                public debug signing key used by the automatic build
```

## Automatic builds

Every change pushed to `main` is built on GitHub's own servers by
[`.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`](.github/workflows/build-apk.yml): it compiles the app, runs the
Urdu unit tests, signs the APKs and publishes them as the latest
[Release](../../releases/latest). The download links above always point at that release, so they
always serve the newest build.

The automatic build signs with `keystore/ci-debug.keystore`, a public debug key kept in the repo so
every build has the same signature. It is fine for testing and judging, not for the Play Store. A
phone that has a copy built on another computer needs that copy uninstalled once before installing
this one.

## Data and privacy

Books never leave the phone. The dictionary, speech and OCR all run on the device. Two things reach
the internet, and only when you ask for them: an online dictionary lookup, and an AI summary sent to
Google Gemini with your own key. There is no account, no analytics and no advertising.
